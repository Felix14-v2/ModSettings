# Mod Settings for Fabric

Makes it easy to access the configuration for all installed mods!

This mod requires Minecraft 1.17.1 and the Fabric loader.

## Download

You can download the latest version here: [modsettings-1.0.0.jar](https://github.com/magicus/modsettings/releases/download/v1.0.0/modsettings-1.0.0.jar)

## Installation

Install this as you would any other Fabric mod. (Personally, I recommend MultiMC as Minecraft launcher for modded Minecraft.)

## Support

Do you have any problems with the mod? Please open an issue here on Github.

Currently only Minecraft version 1.17.1 is supported, but it would probably be trivial to add support for other versions.
If you want support for another version, please open an issue and state the requested version.
